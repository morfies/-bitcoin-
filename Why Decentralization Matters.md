####互联网的两个时代
* 第一个时代是1980s~2000s，这期间互联网服务都是基于开放协议的，这些协议则是由互联网社区维护。在此阶段，中心化显得那么的不重要。
* 第二个时代是2000~至今，一些盈利性的科技公司，如谷歌，亚马逊等，开发软件应用的速度大大于开放协议的发展，尤其是智能手机的爆发，加速了移动应用的发展，并成为了使用互联网的大多数。最终，用户从开放服务渐渐过渡到这些更复杂的中心化服务，即使人们依旧有使用开放服务的场景，但也基本都是通过第三方中心化公司来访问了。


好消息是几十亿的用户能够访问各种各样令人惊讶的新技术，且好多还是免费的；坏消息是，对于创新者、创业者来说，他们很难成功开发新产品，因为担心大公司会随时改变行业规则架空他们。这从而使互联网恶化，变得没那么有趣和没那么活跃了。

####Web3 - 互联网第三个时代  
互联网仍在进化的初期：在接下来的十年，互联网上的核心应用很有可能将被全部重新架构。而赋能这种变化的就是加密经济网络(crypto-economic networks)，一种被比特币引进的新概念。  
加密网络结合了前两个时代好的特点：社区维护和去中心化，二者将赋能并最终超越绝大多数高级的中心化服务。

加密网络构建于基础互联网之上：
1. 使用共识机制，比如blockchain，来维护和更新状态
2. 使用加密货币来激励参与者和维护者


加密网络有多中机制来保证其正常发展：
* 首先，加密网络和参与者之间的协议是开源的
* 其次，they are kept in check through mechanisms for “voice” and “exit.” Participants are given voice through community governance, both “on chain” (via the protocol) and “off chain” (via the social structures around the protocol). Participants can exit either by leaving the network and selling their coins, or in the extreme case by forking the protocol.


In short, cryptonetworks align network participants to work together toward a common goal — the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This alignment is one of the main reasons Bitcoin continues to defy skeptics and flourish, even while new cryptonetworks like Ethereum have grown alongside it.

为什么去中心化最终会赢呢？  
去中心化的网络能够以在web1时代中同样的方式赢取在web3时代： 通过赢取企业家和开发者的心灵和思想。

An illustrative analogy is the rivalry in the 2000s between Wikipedia and its centralized competitors like Encarta. If you compared the two products in the early 2000s, Encarta was a far better product, with better topic coverage and higher accuracy. But Wikipedia improved at a much faster rate, because it had an active community of volunteer contributors who were attracted to its decentralized, community-governed ethos. By 2005, Wikipedia was the most popular reference site on the internet. Encarta was shut down in 2009.

The lesson is that when you compare centralized and decentralized systems you need to consider them dynamically, as processes, instead of statically, as rigid products. Centralized systems often start out fully baked, but only get better at the rate at which employees at the sponsoring company improve them. Decentralized systems start out half-baked but, under the right conditions, grow exponentially as they attract new contributors.

Today, unaccountable groups of employees at large platforms decide how information gets ranked and filtered, which users get promoted and which get banned, and other important governance decisions. In cryptonetworks, these decisions are made by the community, using open and transparent mechanisms. As we know from the offline world, democratic systems aren’t perfect, but they are a lot better than the alternatives.
